				Through the unique design of an individual QR code embroidered on your shirt, you will be able to express a unique side of your personality!

				<h2>What is the concept?</h2>
				<p> We aim to find the most stylish and comfortable oversized t-shirts in black and white (for the first prototypes). We then will embroider individual QR codes on each t-shirt where each customer determines the link through which the QR relates. The QR codes will be dynamic, meaning that their related links can be changed by the owner at any point towards a new link! </p>
				<p>Use your t-shirt as a way to meet new people and show unique aspects of who you are! </p>

				<h2>Where are we at right now?</h2>
				<p> Still at the beginning of our adventure, we are rapidly progressing! We are currently developing the prototypes to see what would look best, working with different ateliers in Paris. Simultaneously we are developing the e-shop and the branding content to start creating a hype around our brand. </p>
				<p> In the next weeks we want to produce 100 prototypes and test a go-to-market, see if our product is viable on the market. </p>
